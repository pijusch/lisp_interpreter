Some comments about the code

1. COUNT takes all kind of inputs (not just restricted to atoms)

2. Symbollics can be assigned values using functions with no arguments
   eg:
	(DEFUN (A ()) 45)
	$
	> A

	(LESS (A) 100)
	$
	> T

	(A)
	$
	> 45

3. Exceptions are handled without traceback and exception name. The code tells about the exception and moves to top level.

4. Error messages: All given in the handout and test cases. (Not exhaustive. During some errors, the control moves to top level without pointing out the exact cause of error.)
